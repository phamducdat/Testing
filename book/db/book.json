      "description": "If you want to learn web design and development, the first step that you should do is to study HTML – the markup language used in making the basic building blocks of web pages. To acquire the skill in coding HTML elements, you need not really have to a formal classroom instruction in a reputable IT university. You can learn it by yourself by religiously following instructional materials online such as W3Schools and Tizag.com, or if you want a more detailed and illustrative presentation, by reading HTML books. Depending on your learning style, you will find either online HTML tutorials to be more convenient or if not, HTML books in paperback. This is actually up to you, so it is best to know where you are comfortable. If you have tried, following the online format and find it hard to digest for some reason, why not try basic HTML education by means of books? Yes, books where you can find illustrations and how-is-it-done examples, in a flip-through-page style as we know it. Here, we are sharing with you some of the HTML books for beginners that we believe are worthy to be considered if you want to learn the ropes of web design and development. Also, we are including books for HTML5, the latest and more powerful version of HTML, as it is an increasingly popular language that will surely define the future of the web. This is where you should direct most of your focus as HTML5 and CSS3 are the standards of the future. Designers have already created a vast number of incredible HTML5 website templates. It is worth the time to check out some HTML5 examples and get inspired. One of the latest trends in Web design is the use of media queries to create responsive web site layouts. HTML5 and CSS3 are at the core of this and we have seen it used a lot and successfully in Responsive WordPress Themes.These books will of course cost you something but it may be a very good investment if you want to have a working knowledge of basic web design and development. If you find any of these books interesting, we encourage you to visit their respective websites to know more about them. They have discussions as to what you will expect from these books should you decide to get yourself a copy. Also, if know of other materials, tools, or anything that can be of use to beginners in making them proficient in HTML, please share your knowledge below in the comments. We will highly appreciate your efforts in helping promising coders uplift their skills"

      "description": "This is the book for web designers, web developers, and front-end coders who want to get up to speed with HTML5 in 2012. This is the book that isn’t afraid to point out what everyone gets wrong about HTML5’s new markup, so you don’t make the same mistakes. This is the book that will show you what rocks in HTML5 today and what the future holds for interactivity and video now Flash is dying. This is the book that doesn’t think marking up a basic web page should be a quasi-religious exercise where the high priests of HTML5 must be consulted for their interpretation of the holy texts (the HTML5 spec). This is the book that doesn’t pull its punches. This is the book for web professionals who think for themselves. This is the book that tells the truth about HTML5. === 5 Reasons You Should Read The Truth About HTML5 1. Learn HTML5 markup the right way After spending an insane number of hours researching HTML5’s new markup I discovered one disturbing fact: everyone gets it wrong. Really. Don’t waste hours trawling through confusing, poorly researched, and often flat-out wrong blog posts (or books). Get the truth on HTML5’s markup in chapter three and chapter four. 2. Learn about the future of semantics Did you know Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft teamed up in 2011 to launch a new, potentially groundbreaking semantics initiative using HTML5’s new microdata standard? They did, and the new semantics are being used by major sites like eBay and IMDB right now. In chapter seven you’ll be brought up to speed on one of the biggest changes to semantics to ever hit the web. 3. Learn what HTML5 features you can implement today HTML5 isn’t one big blob of technology that will be finished at some point in the future. It’s a grab bag of cool stuff, much of which has been around for years. Learn what’s well supported and ready to go today in 2012, including new forms features in chapter eight, and the new audio and video possibilities in chapter ten. 4. Learn what happens when Flash dies The writing is on the wall for Flash. Apple never supported it on mobile; Adobe (Adobe!) have given up on the plug-in for Android; and Microsoft won’t support it in IE10 in the default desktop experience of Windows 8. (Let that sink in for a moment.) Clients will demand HTML5 equivalents of what was done with Flash so we’ll look at what HTML’s Canvas can do in chapter nine and what HTML5 video can (and can’t) do in chapter ten. 5. HTML5 for CMSs, and beyond HTML5 Finally in chapter twelve we’ll look at some of the web app oriented features of HTML5, one of which (the History API) changes something as fundamental as a page refresh. We’ll also touch on features that we should be demanding asking politely to be included in our CMSs, and we’ll look briefly at some post-HTML5 web standards development for mobile that’s becoming a reality right now."

      "description": "HTML has been on a wild ride. Sure, HTML started as a mere markup language, but more recently HTML's put on some major muscle. Now we've got a language tuned for building web applications with Web storage, 2D drawing, offline support, sockets and threads, and more. And to speak this language you've got to go beyond HTML5 markup and into the world of the DOM, events, and JavaScript APIs. Now you probably already know all about HTML markup (otherwise known as structure) and you know all about CSS style (presentation), but what you've been missing is JavaScript (behavior). If all you know about are structure and presentation, you can create some great looking pages, but they're still just pages. When you add behavior with JavaScript, you can create an interactive experience; even better, you can create full blown web applications. Head First HTML5 Programming is your ultimate tour guide to creating web applications with HTML5 and JavaScript, and we give you everything you need to know to build them, including: how to add interactivity to your pages, how to communicate with the world of Web services, and how to use the great new APIs being developed for HTML5. Here are just some of the things you'll learn in Head First HTML5 Programing: Learn how to make your pages truly interactive by using the power of the DOM. Learn how JavaScript APIs fit into the HTML5 ecosystem, and how to use any API in your web pages. Use the Geolocation API to know where your users are.Bring out your inner artist with Canvas, HTML5's new 2D drawing surface. Go beyond just plugging a video into your pages, and create custom video experiences. Learn the secret to grabbing five megabytes of storage in every user's browser. Improve your page's responsiveness and performance with Web workers. And much more."

      "description": "JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to:"

      "author": "Douglas Crockford",
      "src": "/images/javascript/javascript_12.jpg",
      "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must."
